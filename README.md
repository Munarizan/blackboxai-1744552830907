# Pembayaran Yuran - SAR Al-Husna

## Project Overview
Pembayaran Yuran is a web-based application designed to facilitate fee payments for students at SAR Al-Husna. This application provides an intuitive form for parents to submit student details, select payment types, and upload payment slips. The user interface is styled with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a responsive and modern design.

## Installation
To set up the Pembayaran Yuran application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pembayaran-yuran.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd pembayaran-yuran
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.**

### Dependencies
This project relies on the following external libraries:
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework used for the design.

No package manager or specific dependencies are required for backend functionality, as this is a frontend-only application.

## Usage
Upon opening `index.html`, you will see a form consisting of multiple sections:
- **Maklumat Murid**: Input fields for student information.
- **Maklumat Ibu/Bapa**: Input fields for parent information.
- **Pemilihan Yuran**: Options for selecting the payment type.

### Steps to Submit the Form:
1. Fill in all required fields such as student name, class, and parent details.
2. Choose the type of payment from the dropdown.
3. Upload the payment slip.
4. Submit the form using the "Hantar" button.

## Features
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
- User-friendly form with clear labeling.
- File upload option for payment slips.
- Validation of required fields to ensure all necessary information is collected.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:
```
pembayaran-yuran/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file that contains the form
└── css/
    └── style.css       # Custom styles (if any)
└── js/
    └── form.js         # JavaScript for form handling (if any)
```

### Note:
- Ensure that local paths for CSS and JavaScript are correctly set.
- Modify the paths in the HTML file if you change the directory structure.

For further enhancements, such as integrating backend functionality or improving form handling, consider adding server-side scripting and a database connection.

Happy coding!
